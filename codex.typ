== Zen

Common design rules to consider when making new skills and introducing mechanics.

1. *No Redundancy.* Avoid functional overlap unless it introduces a new synergy or cost. Variants of the same thing must interact with different abilities similarly.
2. *Multiplicative Complexity.* Every ability should feed into an existing system, not into another specific ability. Every ability should feel like it works well with something else. No ability should bypass systems.
3. *Heat = Power + Risk*. Abilities that cost _heat_ should be risky, but more powerful. Being dangerous should be encouraged.
4. *Space is Valuable*. Abilities should care about distances, obstacles, adjacency and so on. Avoid global effects.
5. *Thematic Clarity*. Vortices should pull and distort, cannons should shoot, fire must burn and heat things up. The ability's name and flavoring should somewhat aligned and intuitive, not opaque.
6. *Prefer Input Randomness*. Favor random outcomes that are opt-in. Risky skills should be optional, but encouraged and rewarded.
7. *Pink Noise*. Small random outcomes should be more likely than large ones. Big events must be unexpected.
8. *5 Seconds per Skill.* Every feature should be explainable in 5 seconds. Cut it out or rewrite it otherwise.

== Player Types

There are predefined player types that exist, each of them applies 

=== Strategist

Constructs a build and expects the game to cater to it. Long-term resource control and momentum. Likes layered combos and chaining abilities.

// Demand for more board interactions?

=== Schemer

Asymmetric and surprising plays, non-standard and interesting Mechs. Focuses on denying expectations. And direct counters.

=== Gamblers

Chaotic plays, big and risky payoffs. Very tactical and situational builds.
