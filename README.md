# zedmech

The [Rules][./rules.typ] are the actual rules of the game. How to play, turn order, using things, rolling dice and so on.

The [Abilities][./abilities.typ] is the list of reference cards for all the things that you can attach to your Mech. There is also a Machine-readable version of that in [`abilities.yaml`](./abilities.yaml).

The [Codex][./codex.typ] is the designer's guide to making content that works with the rest of Zedmech.
